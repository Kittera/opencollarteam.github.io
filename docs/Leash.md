The Leash is keyed to access rank. Public Access, Group Access, and Trusted cannot take the leash if the wearer is leashed to the Owner. If OwnSelf is unchecked, the wearer cannot unleash herself from any rank of access without using the collar safeword. If the wearer initiates the leash using Pass, the wearer can unleash.
