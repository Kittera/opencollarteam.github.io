# Remote Menu ![alt text](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/opencollarteam.github.io/blob/master/static/Gear.PNG "Remote Menu")
The gear icon at the top left opens the Remote menu where you can add, list and remove subs.  To add a sub you must already have access to her collar.  Public, group, Trusted and Owner access will each allow you to do through the remote what you can do with that level of access through the collar directly.  
# Stop Pose ![alt text](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/opencollarteam.github.io/blob/master/static/StopAnim.PNG "Stop Pose")   
The white square icon, top middle, stops a collar animation.
