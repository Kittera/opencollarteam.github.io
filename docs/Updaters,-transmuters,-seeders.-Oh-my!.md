* The seeder works with the updater to turn a 6.7 or 6.6 collar into a 7.0 collar.
* The updater updates a 3.x or 6.x collar (depending on version in cooperation with the seeder) into a 7.0 collar.

## Updater
To update a 6.x (prior to 6.6) or 2.x collar, simply wear or rez the collar and rez the updater, then use the update functionality of your collar.

## Seeder
To update a 6.6 or 6.7 collar, rez the updater and collar next to each other, then drop the oc_update_seed script into the collar. The update will work automatically.
