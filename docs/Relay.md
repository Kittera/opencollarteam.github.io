The OpenCollar Turbo relay is an integrated HUD attachment. It is linked to the collar to give collar owners access to the Relay settings and prevent the collar wearer from changing those settings.

What is a relay?  The RLV permissions in your viewer are inactive until they are called by a scripted object you own.  The relay works to "translate" calls from objects you don't own through the relay, which you do own.  It's a handshake between scripted objects and the RLV permissions in your viewer.  

# Mode
  
### Ask 
Requires scripted objects to send a request before applying restrictions.   
### Semi-Auto  
Allows objects to apply force sit automatically without a prior request.  Sends a request to apply restrictions.
### Off  
Turns the relay off.  
### Auto (w/Blocks). 
The relay is on auto but includes a blacklist.   
### Auto (w/oBlocks).
