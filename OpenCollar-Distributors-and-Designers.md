OpenCollar Official Partners

OpenCollar offers the Official Partners program for people who wish to host a publicly accessible OpenCollar vendor..  Official Partners are listed on a page on the OpenCollar website/wiki, and we'll refer users to that page when they inquire about where to find OpenCollar-based products.

To qualify as an OpenCollar Official Partner, collar designers and distributors agree to the following*:

--Benefits

1. Name  and inworld location SLURL listed on OpenCollar's Official Partners page.  
2. An initial announcement to the OpenCollar group that you've been made an Official Partner.  
3. The right to use the "OpenCollar Official Partner" name in the description of your inworld parcel.  

DESIGNERS

1. All the requirements for distributors above   
2. Keep your OpenCollar branded products up to date with official releases made to the OpenCollar group.  
3. Provide technical support to your own customers.  
4. Leave the "modify" permission enabled on your OpenCollar products so users can customize and debug them.  

--Benefits

1. All the above benefits to Distributors plus:  
2. The right to use the OpenCollar Official Partner graphic on your complying products.  **Please contact Silkie Sabra inworld with proof of your updated OpenCollar scripted device to receive the textures.**
