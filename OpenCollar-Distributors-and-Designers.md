2. Keep your OpenCollar branded products up to date with official releases made to the OpenCollar group.  
3. Provide technical support to your own customers.  
4. Leave the "modify" permission enabled on your OpenCollar products so users can customize and debug them.  

--Benefits

1. All the above benefits to Distributors plus:  
2. The right to use the OpenCollar Official Partner graphic on your complying products.  **Please contact Silkie Sabra inworld with proof of your updated OpenCollar scripted device to receive the textures.**
