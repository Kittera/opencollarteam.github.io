*OpenCollar Quick User Guide*

#####This page needs to have added to it the most important information that a new collar user needs to know. Non-core features should be described in separate pages, linked below. Quick Start#####

Most collar functions are available in the collar menu. You can always bring up the menu by touching the collar and reviewing the options inside.

Prefixes

In order to prevent one sub's collar from responding to commands meant for a different sub, all chat commands begin with the sub's first two letters of the first name. If the sub's name were greta grumpsalot, her prefix would be "gr". If greta or her Owner wanted to use a chat command to bring up her collar menu, they would say the following:

grmenu
Setting Owner

Once you put on your collar, you will need to set your owner (if you have one). You can set yourself as primary, or set yourself with another as an owner. 

NOTE: If you set an owner while on a position, you will not be able to release yourself from the position you placed yourself in. Your new owner will have to release you from the animation you placed yourself in before you set your owner.
