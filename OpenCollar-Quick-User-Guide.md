*OpenCollar Quick User Guide*

#####This page needs to have added to it the most important information that a new collar user needs to know. Non-core features should be described in separate pages, linked below. Quick Start#####

# Getting Started
Open the Collar Menu by touching the collar or sending a chat command with your prefix.  If you have not set an owner you are the default owner and can access all parts of the collar.  Most collar functions are available in the collar menu. 

## Chat Commands
Chat Commands are typed into the local chat line. Many of the menus and submenus in OpenCollar can be called by using chat commands of the same name as the menu button.

Local chat is on channel 0. If you don't want your command to be visible in local chat, call your menu by typing /1 <prefix> menu. This sends the command to channel 1 instead and you don't see it in local chat.

### Prefixes

Your default prefix is the first two letters of your user name.  Prefixes direct collar commands only to wearers with those two initials.  It can be changed by the collar owner only.  Wearers who have set an owner cannot change the prefix unless OwnSelf is checked.  Suppose your name is Joe Zipcode (joezipcode).  To call the menu you would type:  jo menu . If you want to send the command to channel one it will be /1 jo menu . In this guide we will represent the calls <prefix> menu and so on.

Setting Owner

Once you put on your collar, you will need to set your owner (if you have one). You can set yourself as primary, or set yourself with another as an owner. 

NOTE: If you set an owner while on a position, you will not be able to release yourself from the position you placed yourself in. Your new owner will have to release you from the animation you placed yourself in before you set your owner.
