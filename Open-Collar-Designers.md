See also this section: [Design Partner Application](#application)

These Official Design Partners make many different collar designs and also custom collar apps, in all price ranges.  Enjoy browsing their selections, visit their inworld shops and add them to your Marketplace favorites!  
- Collar Designers are using OpenCollar V 7+ and the OpenCollar scripts remain full permission.  
- Makers of custom apps may use closed source scripts for extra features that link to the collar.  See our [public domain plugin template](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/blob/master/src/spares/oc_plugin_template.lsl) that makes this possible.
