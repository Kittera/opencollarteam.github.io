The RLV can be found at http://www.erestraints.com/realrestraint/

There are other viewers available that contain RLV features in them. Please be aware that for the submissive that the RLV, the Restrained Life Viewer, will make your restraints un-detachable and other restrictive measures that can test your relationship with your submissive.

The Restrained Life Support Group is the best place to get help for installing RLV.

Please remember that this is something that You will need to have an open communication with your submissive about due to the amount of power exchanged between you and your submissive. Is not to be be taken lighty as some are not comfortable with it and will need to grow into wanting to use this to enhance their Second life. We recommend the submissive take a few of the Intro to BDSM and how to use RLV classes in SL if they are not familiar with the features.

Also, other options is to use a third party viewer that has the RLV already built in. Firestorm and various other viewers have this and you just need to check on the "enable RLV" button and then relog for it to be enabled.
