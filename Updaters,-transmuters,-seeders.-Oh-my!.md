**## Transmuter currently unavailable, work in progress and may change **

* The transmuter will turn an old model (3.x, 4.x) collar into a 7.0 collar.
* The seeder works with the updater to turn a 6.7 or 6.6 collar into a 7.0 collar.
* The updater updates a 6.x collar (depending on version in cooperation with the seeder) into a 7.0 collar.

## Updater
To update a 6.x (prior to 6.6) collar, simply wear or rez the collar and rez the updater, then use the update functionality of your collar.

## Seeder
To update a 6.6 or 6.7 collar, rez the updater and collar next to each other, then drop the oc_update_seed script into the collar. The update will work automatically.

## Transmuter
To turn an older collar into a 7.0 collar, rez the collar, updater, and transmuter next to each other.
Drop the xx_transmute and xx_seeder scripts into the collar, then click the transmuter.
Do read the instructions that come with the transmuter if you are using it on a 4.x or later collar.
