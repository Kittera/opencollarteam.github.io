This page explains how to build an OpenCollar using your own prims, without help from the "Collarizer" script. [Illustrations coming soon]  

To build a collar yourself you need only basic inworld building skills with standard prims. If you can make a standard prim of any shape, texture prims, do simple tortured prims, link prims, edit linked prims, and load contents, you can do this.  If this is beyond you, consider taking a basic building class--it will pay off down the line in many ways.  

## Materials
You will need:
1. Collar Band  
2. Tiny Invisible Sphere as Root Prim or named leashpoint
3. Three Stacked Cylinders
