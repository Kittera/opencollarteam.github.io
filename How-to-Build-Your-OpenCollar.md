This page explains how to build an OpenCollar using your own prims, without help from the "Collarizer" script. [Illustrations coming soon]  

To build a collar yourself you need only basic inworld building skills with standard prims. If you can make a standard prim of any shape, texture prims, do simple tortured prims, link prims, edit linked prims, and load contents, you can do this.  If this is beyond you, consider taking a basic building class--it will pay off down the line in many ways.  

## Materials
You will need:
1. Collar Band  
2. Tiny Invisible Sphere as Root Prim or named leashpoint
3. Three Stacked Cylinders about the same diameter as the collar band or very slightly smaller
4. Three prims any shape

## Name your prims
1. Root Prim: Same name as collar
2. Cylinder Prims:  Stack them vertically inside the collar, name the top prim Animator, the middle prim FloatText, and the bottom prim Settings. The top and bottom cylinder prims should be just visible above and below the collar.
3. Remaining prims: One has same name as collar or just leave it as "Object"; another is named Authorizer, the third is named RLV.
