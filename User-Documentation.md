Introduction
OpenCollar (OC) is a set of scripts for a D/s collar similar to other scripted collars in Second Life.

Unlike the other collars, however, OpenCollar is open source.
You are free to copy and redistribute the OC scripts, provided that you leave them full perms.
Read the entire OpenCollar License in the notecard accompanying the scripts.
The OpenCollar architecture is plugin-based, allowing for new features to be added in the future.
Features not found in other collars include:
menu-driven support for the Restrained Love Viewer (formerly Restrained Life Viewer), usually referred to as RLV
ability to automatically punish a sub for saying any word from a list you specify
optional group control, in addition to control by owners and secondary owners (secowners)
menu-driven color and texture settings
automatic updates
online database settings that survive script resets and are automatically transferred if/when the collar is updated
best of all, free open-source code!
Please report any bugs you find or feature requests to the OpenCollar bug tracker at
https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/issues 
Important
OpenCollar automatically sets the command prefix to the wearer's first two letters of the first name. 
Enter the wearer's initials before all the commands below. For example, if Greta Grumpsalot were wearing the collar, she would prefix all commands with her initials "gr", typing for example "grnadu" rather than simply "nadu". Use the prefix command (section 4.0, below) to change the prefix if one other than the default initials is desired.
To give a command to two or more subs at once, use the * wildcard character in place of the usual prefix. For example, *kiss makes all the subs near you in whom you have some degree of ownership (as owner or member of owning group) give you a kiss. The additional prefix # is for subs who also own other subs: commands prefixed by # will work on the collars of all subs in your neighborhood in whom you have rights directly or indirectly, but not on your own collar.

1.0 Menu collar commands
Notes
The command prefix is explained above. When typing the prefix, do not include the brackets shown in the commands listed below.
When using the chat commands, there is no space between the prefix and the command. See further examples below.
Typing /1 with a space before the prefix and command will cause the command not to appear in local chat; for example, /1 grkneel will cause Greta Grumpsalot to kneel, but no one other than the person typing the command will see it.
1.1 - Menus and help
<prefix>menu -- gives you the main menu, from which you can access and issue nearly all commands
<prefix>help -- gives you this help page on a notecard
1.2 - Main collar menus/submenus
Notes
Menus change with different features and versions, also depending on whether you're using RLV or other 3rd party plugins. The menus and items listed here are for a typical configuration.
Main menu submenus
LOCK/*Unlock* -- locks or unlocks the collar; if owned, only the owner can unlock it
Apps- gives you the submenu for collar !addons
Capture - On - Capturing won't require collar wearers's consent. "/1 at capture info off" will deactivate "capture me" announcements. Off, the collar wearer will do this manually. Risky???
Help/Debug -- gives you the help/debug menu, with which you can upgrade your collar and perform other functions
Leash -- gives you the leash menu
RLV -- gives you the menu for Restrained Love Viewer (RLV) functions
Access - Set your owner of the collar, runaway, or set public access or have the collar only be under your ownself.
Settings- Print to chat, load, fix, position, rotation, size, themes
Help/About gives you the help menu, with which you can upgrade your collar and perform other functions like verifying the version, License, news, and contact. Also has the link for the documentation url.
