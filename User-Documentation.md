# Introduction

[Needs new introduction / purpose statement here ]
OpenCollar (OC) is a set of scripts for a D/s collar similar to other scripted collars in Second Life.
Unlike most other collars, however, OpenCollar is open source.
You are free to copy and redistribute the OC scripts, provided that you leave them full perms.
Read the entire OpenCollar License in the notecard accompanying the scripts.

Please report any bugs you find or feature requests to the OpenCollar bug tracker at
