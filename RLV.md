To call the RLV menu:
>[prefix] rlv

**NOTE**: RLV (Restrained Love Viewer) is a set of permissions coded into the viewer, that allows other avatars limited control over some viewer functions.  There are several approved [third party viewers](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Third_Party_Viewer_Directory) that allow you to enable / disable RLV. Among the most popular for many users are Firestorm, Restrained Love Viewer, and Singularity.

Please remember that one of the most basic safety features about RLV is your ability to turn it off and on in the viewer.  Any RLV restriction can be cleared by turning off RLV and relogging; or logging on in the official SL Viewer.
