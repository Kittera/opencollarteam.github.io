To call the RLV menu:
>[prefix] rlv

**NOTE**: RLV (Restrained Love Viewer) is a set of permissions coded into the viewer, that allows other avatars limited control over some viewer functions.  There are several approved [third party viewers](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Third_Party_Viewer_Directory) that allow you to enable / disable RLV. Among the most popular for many users are Firestorm, Restrained Love Viewer, and Singularity.

Please remember that one of the most basic safety features about RLV is your ability to turn it off and on in the viewer.  Any RLV restriction can be cleared by turning off RLV and relogging; or logging on in the official SL Viewer.

## On / Off
Toggles RLV on and off in the collar (not in the viewer).  The collar lock is not affected. Turning RLV Off in the collar does disable the collar relay and turns off access to the RLV menu.

## Clear All
Clears all collar RLV restrictions, including those enforced by the relay.  Available to anyone with collar access but the wearer unless self owned.

## Exceptions

Here you can set Exceptions to RLV restrictions Owners and Trusted.  Most Exceptions are checked by Default.  Exceptions allow owners and trusted to communicate with you and teleport you when these are otherwise restricted.  When the boxes are checked the Exceptions are enforced.

### List of Exceptions:

IM exempts owner/trusted from a block on the wearer's ability to send IMs.  
RcvIM exempts owner/trusted from a block on the wearer's ability to receive IMs.  
RcvChat exempts owner/trusted from a block on the wearer's ability to read local chat.  
RcvEmote exempts owner/trusted from a block on the wearer's ability to read emotes.  
Lure exempts owner/trusted from a block on the wearer's ability to accept a teleport offer.  
refuseTP exempts owner/trusted from the wearer's ability to refuse teleport offers.  When active, the wearer's viewer automatically accepts a tp offer from an owner.  More commonly known as "force TP."  On by default for owners, must be set for trusted.

## Force Sit
Opens a menu of nearby objects on which the wearer can be forced to sit.  Does not include Forbid Stand so does not lock the wearer in the sit.

## Restrictions
Opens a menu of restrictions and named suites of related restrictions.  When the boxes are checked, the restrictions are NOT active.
