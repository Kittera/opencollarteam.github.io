OpenCollar is a set of LSL scripts and related content (such as animations,
sounds, textures, graphics and 3D models) created for SecondLife.  It has many
features, but most are centered on one avatar voluntarily giving some degree of
control to another.

## OpenCollar Needs Your Help

OpenCollar is non-profit and community driven.  Its creators and maintainers
donate their time and talents free of charge.  If you would like to give back,
consider taking a look at our [open

can pitch in.  You can also join the official OpenCollar group in Second Life
and ask the community there how you can help support the project.
