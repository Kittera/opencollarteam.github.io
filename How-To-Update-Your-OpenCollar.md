This page covers four ways to update a collar easily:  From Scratch | 3.X or Older | 4.0-6.5 | 6.6-6.7

# From Scratch

You will need a collar prim and the script named [oc_collarizer](https://github.com/OpenCollarTeam/OpenCollar/blob/1027df9b56903a071c03404725fe0e143c912d73/src/spares/oc_collarizer.lsl) available inworld or upload.

Follow the instructions in the script:
* If you want to use the titler app, add a prim with FloatText in the description field, centered in the collar.
* Rez the updater near the collar prim
* Drop the script named oc_collarizer into your collar prim.
* The update will begin.

# From 3.X or Older

This is worthwhile if your very old collar is a custom build or sentimental item you want to bring up to date. After the update, you may need to rearrange the added child prims in Edit Linked to center them in the collar and make the Animator and Settings prims easier to locate if needed. In very old collars, the rotations may not function as expected.

* Rez or wear the collar
* Rez the updater.
* In the collar menu go to Help / About or Help / Debug
* Press update.  The update will begin. 

# V 4.X - 6.5
This is a very easy update.

* Rez or wear the collar.
* Rez the updater.
* Go to Help / About and Press Udpate
* The update will begin.
